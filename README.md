# NN_2HiggsDoublet
Project uses neural networks to fit the parameter space of the 2 Higgs doublet model https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01309.pdf, which is then minimised via a particle swarm algorithm using a chi squared measure. The scripts then suggest a series of point around the found minima that should be fed into the original scanning algorightm.
